## Product Description and Motivation

We will be creating a web application which will provide tools and resources to gardeners to help them create the best garden possible.
We saw that there is a lack of comprehensive online tools to help gardeners keep track of their gardens, find information, and connect with others all in one place.
 
## Client

NovoFlowers, a NovoLand student who loves to garden but has been having a hard time keeping track of their garden care. Since they have started college they are having a hard time remembering to water their plants and all their different plants’ needs.  and wants a tool that helps them keep their plants happy and healthy and to plan their garden. 

## Target Users
Everyone from beginner to experienced gardeners (accessible to many levels of gardener)
As a busy landscape gardener, I want to be able to track all of my plants’ watering schedules so that I can track the last time they were watered
As a researcher, I want to be able to search for a plant so that I can learn about different plants (planting zone, watering schedules, etc)

# Features
10 features with data storage, retrieval, display, and data consistency all be demonstrated:
- Accounts
- List of plants in your garden 
- List of favorite plants
- Ability to view other user’s gardens
- Database of plants that users can search 
- Users can post about their gardens and ask questions
- Users can reply to posts in order to answer questions
- Users can see which plants they need to water that day/a watering schedule
- Users will have a fertilizer schedule 
- Users will receive suggestions on what to plant this month

## User Testing Plan
After a feature has been deemed completed and has been deployed to the test website for Flora, we will test it with a potential user of the platform 
For example:
Family members
New college students
New College faculty

## QA Testing Plan
Feature is implemented by team member → Feature is sent to Sami or Chloe for testing → feature is tested → if feature is working, it is deployed and it moves on to user testing → if feature is not working, it is returned to the team member that was working on it for debugging
