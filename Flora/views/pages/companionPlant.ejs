  <h2 id="whatIs">What is companion planting?</h2>
  
  <p>Companion planting is when two or more plants are grown near each other so that they will mutually benefit each other.  There are a variety of ways that plants can benefit each other while growing. Some plants may reduce pests for other plants or increase nutrients for another plant.  Other plants attract polinators, which results in better crop yeild.</p>
  <!--Should prob add citation or pic or somthing..-->

  <hr class="dashed">

  <h2 id="benefit">Benefits of Companion Planting:</h2>
  <p>Companion planting can boost soil nutrients, attract polinators, reduce pests, reduce weeds, reduce soil erosion as well as shelter plants. </p>
  <p>Some plants, such as legumes, can fix nutrients in the soil. Legumes (such as beans) fix nitrogen in the soil through a symbiotic relationship wiht the bacteria, Rhizobia.  Both the legumes and the bacteria, Rhizobia, are benefitting from their relationship. </p>
  <p>Plants that attract benefical polinators benefit your entire garden. They will help your plants increase their crop yeild.  Attracting polinators supports your local ecosystem. </p>
  <p>Certain plants will attract benefical insects that can reduce pests.  Aphids, a common garden pest, are eaten by ladybug larvae. By planting companion plants that attract beneficial insect, you can reduce the pesticides used in your garden. </p>
  <p>Other plants act as a cover crop to reduce soil erosion, weeds, and to improve soil health. </p>
  <p>Some plants can provide sun and wind shelter for other plants. </p>

  <h2 id="example">Companion Plant Examples</h2> <!--Three sisters method-->
  <p>The Three Sisters method was used by the Iroquois.  They planted beans, corn, and squash together.  The beans added nitrogen to the soil. The corn stalks provide support for the beans to grow upwards. The squash covers the ground, preserving the soil's moisture and preventing weeds. </p> <!--Add citation-->
  <p>The Three Sisters method is still commonly used today. </p>

  <p>Other companion plant pairings have been found by gardeners through experimentation.  Basil is often planted near tomatoes to discourage common pests that attack tomato plants.</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <hr class="dashed">

  <h2 id="commonCompanion">Common Companion Plant Pairings:</h2>
  <p>Here are a few common plant pairings: </p>
  <ul> <!--List of common companion plants-->
    <li>Tomato benefits from being planted with basil and a few other herbs. Basil repels common tomato plant bugs like whiteflies, spider mites, and aphids. Basil attracts polinators that benefit the plant. Calendula, dill, and thyme also repel tomato plant pests. Garlic is a natural pest repellant for tomato plants due to its strong odor. Asparagus can protect tomato plants from fungus from a natural fungicide that they produce. Tomato plants can also benefit asparagus plants by repelling asparagus beetles. </li>
    <br>

    <br>

    <li>Zucchini benefits from being planted with oregano and zinnias to attract polinators. Borage can also attrack polinators as well as deter pest worms. Dill attracts benefical insects that repel pests like cucumber beetles. It can also be planted with Buckwheat to reduce pests. Beans can fix the nitrogen levels in the soil which creates a more suitable PH level for Zucchini. </li>
    <br>

      <img src="images/companionPlants/oreganoCompanion.jpg" alt="Oregano Plant">
    </div>  
    
    <br>
    
    <li>Spinach benefits from being planted with herbs like cilantro, oregano, and rosemary to help repel pests. Beans can provide shade for spinach. Onion and garlic can repel pests with their strong scent. They also attract beneficial insects. Plants like broccoli and cabbage are good companion plants for spinach because their root systems are a different soil layer than spinach. When picking companion plants for your garden it is important to make sure they are not competing for nutrients. Planting lettuce with spinach can benefit both plants. Together, they produce more ground cover which lowers the soil temperature, allowing the plant to produce more.  Strawberries produce a similar ground cover effect when planted with lettuce.</li>
