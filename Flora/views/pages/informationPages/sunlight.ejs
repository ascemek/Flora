    <h2 id="whyNeedLight">Why Do Plants Need Light?</h2>
    <br>
    <p> All living things need food and water. For plants, light is food. They use it in a vital 
      process known as photosynthesis, wherein the energy of light is captured by chloroplasts, 
      sparking multiple metabolic reactions — one of these being creating sugars (food) for plants. 
      Sugars fuel plant growth, so the more light a plant is exposed to, the more energy it will 
      create and the faster it will grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Know these pairs:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <ls>
        <li>Quality = Color</li>
        <li>Quantity = Intensity</li>
      </ls>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These characteristics of light are important in understanding how and why a plant will behave in your home.
    </p>
  
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2 id="effectOfLight">How Plants are Affected by Light?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      When plants lack light, they don't produce chlorophyll (the green pigment in plants), and plants can turn pale 
      green to yellow to white. Plant stems become “leggy,” meaning stems become long and thin and appear to be reaching 
      toward the source of light. A lack of sufficient light causes the plant to grow long spaces on stems between the 
      leaf nodes (the point where a leaf grows out from the stem). Plants without sufficient light may also drop their 
      leaves, especially older leaves. You may find that a variegated plant (leaves that are white and green) may revert 
      to being solid green. Flowering plants may fail to produce flower buds. Plants exposed to too much light may result 
      in scorched and bleached leaves.
    </p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <hr class="dashed">
  
    <h2 id="lightTypes">Choosing The Right Plant</h2>
    <p>Before getting a plant or starting seeds, determine the quality and hours of natural light in your space. Then choose 
      plants with light requirements that match your indoor environment. While a plant may tolerate lower light growing conditions, 
      more light may be required to promote dense foliage and flowering.</p>
    <ls>
      <h3>Low Light</h3>
      <p>
        (PPF: 50-150 umol m-2s-1 / 50-250 foot-candles / 10-15 watts)
      </p>

      <li>A low-light plant would be suitable for a north window or a fairly dark corner.</li>
      <li>Low-light plants require little to no direct light. In their native growing environments, these plants are “understory plants” meaning they grow underneath the branches of larger plants.</li>
      <li>Low lighting is not sufficient for starting seeds indoors.</li>
      <li>In environments with less light, plants grow more slowly and use less water. Avoid overwatering by feeling the soil.</li>

      <br>

      <h3>Medium Light</h3>
      <p>
        (PPF: 150-250 umol m-2s-1 / 250-1,000 foot-candles / 15-20 watts)
      </p>

      <li>A medium-light plant would be suitable for east-facing windows or located near a west-facing window, but out of direct light.</li>
      <li>You would need artificial lighting for starting seeds in medium light.</li>
      <li>Like the low light plants, these plants will not dry out as quickly. Avoid overwatering by feeling the soil.</li>

      <br>

      <h3>High Light</h3>
      <p>
        (PPF: 250-450 umol m-2s-1 / more than 1,000 foot-candles, more than 20 watts)
      </p>

      <li>A high-light plant would be suitable for brightly lit locations such as south- or southwest-facing windows.</li>
      <li>You may be able to start seeds without artificial lighting, but seeds that need more time indoors, such as tomatoes and peppers, may become leggy without extra light.</li>
      <li>High-light areas can be warm, making plants dry out faster. Check these plants more frequently and water when soil is dry. </li>
    </ls>

    <h2 id="houseplants">Houseplants for Different Indoor Light Conditions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Just like choosing plants for sunny or shady areas of your outdoor garden, it’s important to choose plants that will grow in 
      the existing light conditions indoors. And you may decide to add artificial grow lights to increase light energy to your plants.
      The following houseplants are listed under the light conditions that provide the best indoor growing environment. 
    </p>

      <h3>Low Light</h3>
      <p>
        Low light is often loosely described as a light level  "bright enough to read a newspaper." Most low-light plants are grown for 
        their foliage, not flowers. A low-light plant would be suitable for a north window or a fairly dark corner. In their native 
        growing environments, these plants are "understory plants" meaning they grow underneath the branches of larger plants.
      </p>

      <li>Chinese evergreen (Aglaonema)</li>
      <li>Cast iron plant (Aspidistra)</li>
      <li>Ponytail palm (Beaucarnea recurvata)</li>
      <li>Parlor palm (Chamaedorea)</li>
      <li>English ivy (Hedera helix)</li>

      <br>

      <h3>Medium Light</h3>
      <p>
        These plants grow well indoors in areas that are well-lit such as in east-facing windows or near a west-facing window, but out 
        of direct sunlight. You’ll often find medium-light plants in spaces where fluorescent lights are on all day such as an office building.
      </p>

      <li>Amaryllis (Hippeastrum)</li>
      <li>Elephant ear (Alocasia)</li>
      <li>Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria)</li>
      <li>Asparagus fern (Asparagus)</li>
      <li>Rubber plant (Ficus elastica)</li>

      <br>

      <h3>High Light</h3>
      <p>
        High light areas are brightly lit locations such as south- or southwest-facing windows. As a rule of thumb, most plants grown for their 
        flowers require high-light growing conditions.
      </p>

      <li>Geraniums (Pelargonium)</li>
      <li>Poinsettia (Poinsettia)</li>
      <li>Non-hardy azalea (Rhododendron)</li>
      <li>Gardenia (Gardenia) </li>
      <li>Jasmine (Jasminum)</li>

    <h2 id="artificialLight">Adding Artificial Lighting</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Artificial lighting can be added to make up for the lack of natural sunlight. Once you have an idea of the available light in your space and 
      the plants you’d like to grow, you may decide to add supplemental lighting. The most common types of lighting include LED and fluorescent bulbs, 
      but you may see incandescent and high-pressure sodium bulbs when shopping around. There are pros and cons to using each type, and all can be found
       at local hardware stores or online.
